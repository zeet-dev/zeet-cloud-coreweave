Thank you for installing Traefik Ingress Controller. The following contains your configuration information.

NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available. You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} svc -w {{ include "traefik.fullname" . }}'

{{ if .Values.externalDns.enabled }}

                  DNS Name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| {{ include "traefik.externalHostName" . }} 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is recommended that you point DNS records to the ingress controller by using a CNAME to `<dns name>`. Alternatively, if CNAME is not an option, the Load Balancer IP listed in the services section can be used.

It is important to note that for all requests to get through to your controller you will need a wildcard (*) in the Ingress below or you will need to 
create a a DNS entry for your domain to point to the Controller DNS (when using our external DNS).
